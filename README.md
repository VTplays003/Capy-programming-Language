Welcome, I made this for fun, don't take this seriously.
I WILL UPDATE IT WHEN I FEEL LIKE IT
I code in VS Community 2022 which means your code (when pasting into a different place) might have errors.

UPDATE LOG:
v1.1 Added new features to CapyConsole class including Console.Beep() and other stuff turned capy
